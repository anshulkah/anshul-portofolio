    "Software Developer, I love building things on the web using NextJS and on the mobile using React Native.",
  summary: `Hey, I'm Anshul, a software developer with a passion for web development. I love building various web applications and have expertise in creating scalable solutions using NextJS and React. My experience extends to mobile app development with React Native.
In addition to these core technologies, I've worked with GraphQL for efficient data querying, Docker for containerization, and TypeScript for enhanced code reliability. I'm well-versed in Node.js.
I'm always eager to learn new technologies and apply them to interesting projects. Whether it's optimizing backend services, implementing complex frontend architectures, or diving into cloud technologies like AWS or Google Cloud Platform, I'm ready to take on new challenges.
